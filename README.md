## Introduction

This is part of the Digital Humanities Hackathon 2023 (DHH23) project. The theme of our group was Enlightening Illustrations: Analyzing the Role of Images in Early Modern Scientific Publications. This is a continuous of the project to explore and analyse how the computer vision tools could be used to identify similar images among the dataset. This information would be essential for understanding how the pictures where re-used during the 18th century.
