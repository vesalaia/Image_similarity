## Introduction

This is part of the Digital Humanities Hackathon 2023 (DHH23) project. The theme of our group was Enlightening Illustrations: Analyzing the Role of Images in Early Modern Scientific Publications. This is a continuous of the project to explore and analyse how the computer vision tools could be used to identify similar images among the dataset. This information would be essential for understanding how the pictures where re-used during the 18th century. 

## Approach

The basic idea is to use deep learning methods to convert images to vectors and use similarity metrics to identify other similar images among the dataset. Cosine similarity is is used to measure of the similarity between two image feature vectors. It measures the angle between the vectors, if the value is close to one vectors are similar and if it is close to zero then there is no similarity. Cosine similarity is often used to compare the similarity between documents and images.
